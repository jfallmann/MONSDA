Okay, now we reach the analysis workflows. Here is another important detail that
you have to take into account. For DE, DEU and DAS you have to determine
comparison groups and you can choose different analysis tools.

The comparison groups are particularly important at this point. You have to
specify them according to the ics structure. NextSnakes will collect the samples
and put them bundled up into the analysis tools. Use the ICS-encoding for this.

You will understand it, when you look at the following example.
This is how it should look like in the configfile:

            "DAS": {
                    "TOOLS": {
                        "edger": "Analysis/DAS/EDGER.R",
                        "diego": "Analysis/DAS/DIEGO.py"
                    },
                    "COMPARABLE": {
                        "contrast_WTvsKO": [
                            [
                                "mir124:WT:day_0",
                                "mir124:WT:day_1",
                                "mir124:WT:day_2",
                                "mir124:WT:day_3"
                            ],
                            [
                                "mir124:KO:day_0",
                                "mir124:KO:day_1",
                                "mir124:KO:day_2",
                                "mir124:KO:day_3",
                            ]
                        ],
                        "contrast_d0": [
                            [
                                "mir124:WT:day_0"
                            ],
                            [
                                "mir124:KO:day_0""
                            ]
                        ]
                    }

You can also see here, that the tools are assigned to the directory where you
can find their analysis-scripts.
Also consider, that you will find the results of the analyses under the name,
you gave the groups. In this case 'contrast_WTvsKO' and 'contrast_d0'.

okay, now we can continue..
