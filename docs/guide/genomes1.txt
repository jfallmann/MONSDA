                            > GENOME REFERENCES  <

Now we look at the 'GENOMES'-folder. It has also been created in your PROJECT-
FOLDER. Later the WORKFLOWS you involve will find references like GTF- or
FASTA-files here.
MONSDA implements two features, you need to know about:

 > It can happen, that your data includes multiple organisms, like in the example
   above. For that case MONSDA needs one subdirectory per organism in
   the GENOMES-folder. But even if you only have one organism, the
   subdirectory is necessesary.

   In the following example we have samples from Human and Drosophila.


 > Furthermore you can use extensions for your genome-files in case you want to
   use specific genomes for different runs.

   For 'Human' you want to use 'hg38.reduced.fa.gz' and 'hg38.extended.fa.gz'
   For 'Drosohphila' only 'dm6.fa.gz'

   In that case we you have the basenames 'hg38' and 'dm6'. And you have
   '.reduced' and '.extended' as additional identifier for 'Human'.


 > Please notice that MONSDA will append the ending '.fa.gz' automatically.
   You won't have to type it anywhere yourself.

Well, to set up all that properly in the CONFIGFILE, you have to do four steps:

1. First you have to specify a key-value pair in the CONFIGFILE that assigns the
   organisms your samples come from to the basename(!) of a FASTA-file.
   MONSDA will append the ending '.fa.gz' automatically.

   In the CONFIGFILE it will look like this for example:

                "GENOMES": {
                    "Human": "hg38",
                    "Drosophila": "dm6"
                }

2. Additionaly the 'SOURCE' section assigns each ics to one of your Organism.
   If you have only one, the Guide can do this for you. Otherwise you have to.

                "SOURCE": {
                    "id": {
                        "condition": {
                            "setting_1": "Human"
                            "setting_2": "Drosophila"
                        }
                    }
                }

3. After that you can assign the additional identifier to the ics. As i said,
   this will extend the FASTA-file basenames and is called 'NAME' in CONFIGFILE.

                "NAME": {
                    "id": {
                        "condition": {
                            "setting_1": ".extended"
                            "setting_2": ".normal"
                        }
                    }
                }

4. Finally you also have to specify the sequencing type.

                "SEQUENCING": {
                    "id": {
                        "condition": {
                            "setting_1": "paired"
                            "setting_2": "unpaired"
                        }
                    }
                }


All in all our example will leads MONSDA to following files:

 > /GENOMES/Human/hg38.extended.fa.gz
 > /GENOMES/Drosophila/dm6.normal.fa.gz

Now, let's start with the first step!
