                             > THE PROJECT-FOLDER <

Okay, first we take care of your PROJECT-FOLDER. It will fill up more and more
over time. But in the beginning you need only three subfolders, that we're going
to create now:

> The 'FASTQ'-folder will contain your sequencing raw-data in a certain structure.
> The 'GENOMES'-folder will contain all needed reference genomes and annotations.
> The 'snakes'-folder will be inserted as symlink to this repository copy.

For now its enough just to create this three - the GUIDE will do that for you.
Later we fill them. The best and clearest way to use NextSnkaes would be to
create a directory 'MONSDA' where you can store several projects side by side.
But this is up to you, only the existence of the above inside your PROJECT-FOLDER
is really necessary.
