                            > SWITCH ON WORKFLOWS  <

Fine, we have now established the basic structure of your project. In the next
step you have to determine which WORKFLOWS you want to run. For understanding,
MONSDA differentiated betwween WORKFLOWS and POSTPROCESSING analyses.
Later you have a few more options at the POSTPROCESSING steps but for now it's
enough just to know that.

Accordingly in the CONFIGFILE you will find two dictionary keys at the top of
the file. Here you can switch on workflows by entering them here. A specific
order is not needed.
for example, it can look like this:

                    "WORKFLOWS" :       "QC,TRIMMING,MAPPING",
                    "POSTPROCESSING" :  "DE",

That is the meaning of the available WORKFLOWS and POSTPROCESSINGs:

 > QC         Quality Control
 > TRIMMING   Trimming
 > MAPPING    Mapping (with star mapper)
 > ANNOTATE
 > COUNTING
 > TRACKS
 > PEAKS

 > DE         Differential Expression analysis
 > DEU        Differential Exon-Usage analysis
 > DAS        Differential Alternative Splicing analysis

In addition to these key-value pairs the CONFIGFILE will contain a seperate
section for each of the specified WORKFLOWS. Please note, that we go through
these detailed settings later. Now you just determine, which section will be
prepared.
