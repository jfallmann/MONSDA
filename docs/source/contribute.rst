If you like this project, are missing features, want to contribute or
file bugs please leave an issue or contact me directly.

To contribute new tools feel free to adopt existing ones, there should
be a number of examples available that cover implementation details
for almost all sorts of standard tools. If you need to add new
python/groovy functions for processing of options or parameters add
them to the corresponding file in the lib directory.  New environments
go into the envs directory, new subworkflows into the workflows
directory. Do not forget to also extend the template.json and add some
documentation.

PRs always welcome.
